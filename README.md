# Car-Ride-Company
This is a thorough exploratory data analysis for a car ride company





# Business Understanding
You may have some experience of traveling to and from the airport. Have you ever used Uber/bolt or any other cab service for this trip? Did you face the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars?
These problems also affect other ride companies, as their revenue is tied to the trips made. 
This problem of non availability and cancellation needs to be investigated.
 * Objectives
 
Root cause analysis: identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation.
